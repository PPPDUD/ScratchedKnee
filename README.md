# ScratchedKnee
ScratchedKnee is a ScratchAttach-based username collection bot for Scratch.

# About the password in the original source code
I accidentally left a password for my Scratch account in the original version of this source code.

After someone decided to steal my account this way, I changed my password to something more secure.

As an unintended side effect, some early copies of `ScratchedKnee` stopped working because they tried to log into my account with the wrong password.

This bug has now been fixed and the password no longer works.
